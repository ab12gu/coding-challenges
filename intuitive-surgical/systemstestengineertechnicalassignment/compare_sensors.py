# 
# filename: sensory.py
# by: Abhay Gupta
#
### desc:
# - Write a command-line program that takes first argument
# a path to a text file with a series of readings from each sensor
# - Compare two sensor data series
# - Print to the console a single message:
#     - indicate whether error was detected
#     - If detected, print time of error
# - if any imports are used, they must be from standard lib
# and justified

#
### Hardware: 
# - Motor
# - Encoder: attached between motor and gearbox
#     - 2048 counts per revolution of motor
#     - signed # for encoder counts
#     - 0 at boot time
# - Gearbox 30:1 ratio
# - Potentiometer: attached to output of shaft of gearbox
#     - range 0 -> 5V
#     - cycles linearly as a sawtooth wave per revolution
#     - voltage read by 8 bit A/D converter
#     - unsigned 0 = 0V, 255 = 5V
#     - absolution sensor - at boot time, non-zero position
# - Potentiometer/Encoder
#     - Fixed offset must be computed at start up 
#     - Assume both sensors are correct during first 0.5 seconds
#     - Usable time to initilize/calibrate algorithms

### imports

# Arguments are stored in the sys moduleâ€™s argv attribute as a list
# Alternative: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27368717/10051223
# Commentary: Instructions are weird to say to not use imports but then
# the first step requires an import...
