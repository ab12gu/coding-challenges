Solved Leetcode Questions

- leetcode          - hard to solve, but they are rare convoluted. 
                    - Has nice auto-tests. 
                    - Fast lane to practice coding for interviews.

- geekforgeeks      - similar to leetcode. 
                    - But every problem usually starts from an explanatory article. 
                    - Good for learning about algorithms and new techniques.

- hackerrank        - has a lot of programming problems, as well as math, AI, etc problems. 
                    - But programming problems there are rather intentionally convoluted since they are primarily for the programming contests. 
                    - People doing contests regularly are very good at pattern matching and can map a problem to a solution very fast, so they need to be distracted a bit by introducing some indirect problem statements. 
                    - So, IMO hackerrank is not that helpful in cracking the coding interviews, but is very valuable just for improving problem solving skills.

- codeforces        - very similar to hackerrank, but with more focus on conducting programming contests. 
                    - But it does have a huge problems archive and auto-tests.

- topcoder          - for programming contests professionals.

- rosettacode       - how to implement X in language Y. 
                    - Very interesting compilation of standard problems and corresponding solutions.

- codingame         - automated platform for writing game bots and alike. 
                    - Can be very fun, with nice visualization and competitive features. 
                    - Definitely improve your coding and math skills but solutions often are heuristic-based.
