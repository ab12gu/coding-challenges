- Explain everything that happens after you type: "http://uw.edu" into the web browser. Be as detailed as possible

By typing in a url into the web browser, you are requesting a files to be displayed from the specified location on a web server. You are able to request data from from either locally or from the world wide web. The first process the browser completes is parsing the typed input and will determine that you want data from a web server due to the specification of a domain name (uw.edu) and the file transfer protocol (http). The browser takes the domain and translates it to an IP address through a DNS (domain name system) server. The DNS server is acting like a phone book. After the IP address is determined, the browser will attempt to connect to the server based on that address. You could have typed the IP address directly into the browser to avoid DNS lookup, but this is generally only done by power users for specific tasks. 

Unfortunately, the domain isn't https, therefore it isn't as secure of a protocol through use of https over http. However, I will not digress into these variations. The browser will still send a HTTP request message to the web server to retrieve information. The message contains some metadata such as the url, browser type, and operating system for rendering purposes. The web server then responds to the request with content of the website if the request is sufficiently complete. The data returned will be HTML/CSS plus additional files that need to be rendered. 

Lastly, the browser will parse the incoming data and hopefully display it correctly. Display issues occur from a variety of issues, invalid paths, unsupported browser type, incompatible aspect ratio, older (or newer) browser version than the one developed for or supported for are just a few examples. There is also a browser process that stores your data into a cache that allows for quick data retrieval, however, I will assume this is a new query :).
