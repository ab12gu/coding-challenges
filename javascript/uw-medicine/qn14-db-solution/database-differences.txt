What is the difference between MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Redshift? Describe the pros and cons of each.


MySQL (popular for web)
- Open-source relational data management system (RDBMS)
- Pros: Easy to use, scalability, flexibility, speed, reliability, low cost
- Cons: Can't handle large DBs well, poor complex query handling, and lack of support, less features than other Dbs

MariaDB (popular for web)
- Open-Source RDBMS based on MySQL (a fork)
- Pros: Speed, scalability, security, compatible with MySQL, addresses large dB issues
- Cons: smaller user community than MySQL

PostgreSQL
- Object relational DB rather than just relational (ORDBMS)
- Pros: Robustness, reliability, large db handling, complex query handling, nice search features, extensibility, highly ACID-compliant
- Cons: slower than prior 2 dbs and harder to use

Redshift (designed for large scale data-analytics)
- Cloud-based data warehouse service based on PostgreSQL
- Pros: Scalability, speed, low-cost, large db handling, complex query handling, integration w/ aws services
- Cons: Limited support for transactions and some SQL features
